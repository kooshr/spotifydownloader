# spotifydownloader - Kaushal Ramesh

This project is used to download spotify playlists as mp3 files using spotDL and customtkinter apis. In order to initialize the project, first download/clone if from git hub.

Then run 
```
pip install spotdl 
```
and
```
spotdl --download-ffmpeg
```

to install customtkinter, run
```
pip install customtkinter
```

When Running the application, it does take some time to load for larger playlists to be patient =)
